# Screen-Time-Tracker-and-Management
Developed an interactive Screen Time Tracker and Management Dashboard using Python and Streamlit, enabling users to upload and analyze their screen time data. The application automatically cleans the data, provides aggregated metrics for app usage and daily trends, and visualizes the data with various interactive charts like bar plots, line charts, and pie charts. The dashboard also includes an alert system to notify users of excessive screen time, promoting healthier digital habits. Leveraged Pandas for data manipulation, Streamlit for the web interface, and Matplotlib/ Seaborn for data visualization, creating a user-friendly platform for effective screen time management.
